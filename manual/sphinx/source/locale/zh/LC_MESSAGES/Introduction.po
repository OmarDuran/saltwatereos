"Realistic simulations of fluid flow in natural hydrothermal systems "
"require accurate formulation of fluid properties especially for seawater "
"convection at mid-ocean ridges. In order to explore circulation patterns "
"and realistic phase seperation phenomenon, we have to calculate equation "
"of state of binary salt-water fluids over pressure-temperature-salinity "
"ranges encountered in the Earth's crust. Fortunately, pure water can be "
"described by the IAPS-84 equation of state and "
":cite:`Driesner2007Part1,Driesner2007Part2` have developed a set of "
"correction formulations of phase relations and thermodynamic properties "
"for NaCl-H2O system. Further, we have developed a set of multi-language ("
" `C++ <https://www>`_ , `Swift <https://www>`_ , `Python <https://www>`_ "
", `Matlab <https://www>`_ ) and multi-platform ( `Windows <https://www>`_"
" , `MacOS <https://www>`_ , `Linux <https://www>`_ , `IOS <https://www>`_"
" ) tools, including callable `C++ library <https://www>`_ , `desktop "
"application <../Application/desktop.html>`_ with graphical user interface"
" (GUI), `command line tools <https://www>`_ (just like `gmt "
"<http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu>`_ style), and Mobile apps for `iphone "
"<https://www>`_ and `ipad <https://www>`_ . In addition, parallel "
"computing is available for desktop application and command line tool."
